# Reversi

A couple weeks ago a group of friends was brainstorming activities for
their Ruby meetup when a lightbulb went off and one of them suggested
implementing games in code.
This was found to be a good idea by some of the others and thus it was
decided that it were to be so.

This game is our exploratory attempt at implementing a game so we have a
better picture of what to expect during the meetups. We opted to start
with Reversi (or Othello) since it's a popular, simple game with only a
handful of rules â€” our implementation, if not the game itself.

We've decided to go with Rust because someone (me) wanted an excuse to
write more Rust code, and because it's a nice change of pace from all
the dynamic languages.

See ya on the flip side.
